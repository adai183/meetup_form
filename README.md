UDACIOUS TRIBE MEET UP FORM
====
I am working on a project to facilitate meet ups for Udacity Students.
The idea is to find out where you live and how far you are willing to travel for a  udacious meetup.

I know it sounds a little scary. But don’t worry. You don’t have to tell your real name. And we only ask for your country and postal code. So your exact location is still private.

I am also looking for collaborators.
Would be also great to find map-lovers or datavis geeks. Feel free to contact me! 
The vis is still pretty basic. Just a circle with the location in the center.
The circle’s radius is the max distance he/she is willing to travel for a meetup.
If circles overlap we have a good location for a meetup. Pretty simple.
